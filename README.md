# TS-Basics
Reviewing fundamentals of Typescript.
Very basic, unlabelled form will print out message if you type in a name into first box, and age into second. I know its not obvious, complex, scrutinized, etc.
App does a few random things in console too based on just practice understanding why TypeScript can do on top of JS.
Also serves as some personal notes for me on it.
